# Custom Keycap Build Guide

## Required parts

Part name | Remarks | Photo |
| ------- | ------- | ----- |
| PBT Keycaps | PBT has a higher melting point than ABS |
| Heating element | This can be anything that can get up to 220 f | 
| Clamp/Lever | This is optional if you don't mind doing a lot of manual pressing | 
| Dye Sub Prints | You can convert an Ink Jet Printer to do Dye sublimination printing but it would be over 30 sheets for it to break even. |  


## Introduction
This document is intended to be a culmination of the information gathered around the process of Sublimination dyeing custom legends of PBT keycaps. Getting it right can take some trial and error but hopefully with this guide, some of the pain points can be avoided.

## Creating the Legends
Utilizing the blank keycap template (forked from this video: ) open it in some sort of vector graphics software, such as Adobe Illustrator, Inkscape, CorelDRAW, etc. Starting with the Alphas, choose the font for the keycaps and size them according to your desired legend size. If a sub-alpha is also wanted, choose that font and add those as well. 

// Post an video portion going over the alpha and sub-alpha creation.

### Icons and Logos
When it comes to icons and logos there are a couple of ways to approach this. 
1. Design and draw the logos yourself. 
2. Utilize an image tracing software and find pictures of it online. (If you are using other people's art do not create commercially).
3. Trace your own vectors based on other images. 

// Post a video of these options. 

### Cross key art 
One of the major benefits of creating your own keycaps (besides being able to choose your legends and icons) is that you can create art/icons that span multiple keycaps. 

// Post a picture of the top level pictures. 

A good way to line these up correctly is to find a picture of your board and align the keycaps with the ones on that picture. This gives you the best chance of the art on the keycaps being consistant from key to key.
